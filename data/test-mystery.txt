[Judy] doesn't feel so well.

////

Neither does Jim... 

Or so it seems to Judy's brain... "Jim's mood is so strange. I wonder if I shouldn't make him another pot of coffee, he let his morning cup go cold."

She wobbles on her feet, "I sure feel strange today."

On the livingroom couch Jim watches television. Behind him, Judy watches the back of his head. The laughter of a studio audience of some old gameshow has no affect on the very curious scowl on Jim's face.

Slowly approach and [touch Jim], ask [is everything okay?]

Examine the [coffee table].

//// 
Next to the stale mug of coffee is a [newspaper] that catches Judy's eye.

Brain voice: "What has he been reading? What article put him in this strange mood. He's so distant and miserable. His eyes are bagged and frightening."

//// Newspaper
With a tremble in her hand, Sandra reaches for the newspaper on the coffee table.

His voice startles her. "No. I'm not finished with that."
{continue}

Retreat to the [bathroom] or [Jim's Office]


////bathroom
"Whatever have I done to make Jim unhappy?"

The bathroom is very tidy, Judy staggers in with a bit of a wobble. She holds the door for balance.

"I just don't feel myself today."

Examine the [trashbin], [bathtub], [mirror].

//// trashbin
You examine the trashbin.  There's nothing in it.  (Phew!)
